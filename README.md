Linear Regression:

A basic and widely used statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the target variable and finds the "best-fit" line that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual values.

Robust Regression:

Robust regression methods are designed to be less affected by outliers or errors in the dataset. They aim to provide more reliable estimates by using techniques that downweight the influence of outliers on the model's parameters, making the model more robust to deviations from the assumptions of classical linear regression.

Ridge Regression:

A type of regularized linear regression that adds a penalty term (L2 norm) to the linear regression formula. This penalty helps to shrink the coefficients towards zero, preventing overfitting and reducing the model's sensitivity to multicollinearity.

LASSO Regression:
Similar to Ridge Regression, but it uses a different penalty term (L1 norm) that tends to produce sparse coefficients by forcing some of them to be exactly zero. This feature selection property can be beneficial for models with many irrelevant or redundant features.

Elastic Net:

A combination of LASSO and Ridge regression, using both L1 and L2 regularization terms. Elastic Net addresses some of the limitations of LASSO by balancing between the advantages of Ridge (handling multicollinearity) and LASSO (feature selection).

Polynomial Regression:

A form of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. This allows fitting curves to the data, accommodating more complex relationships than simple linear regression.

Stochastic Gradient Descent:

An optimization algorithm used for training machine learning models. It works by updating model parameters iteratively by computing gradients on small subsets of the dataset (mini-batches), making it particularly efficient for large datasets.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):

A class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. ANNs consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers and are capable of learning complex patterns from data. They're widely used in various tasks including regression, classification, and pattern recognition.

Random Forest Regressor:

A machine learning algorithm based on ensemble learning. It constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees, which often results in higher accuracy and reduced overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

Support Vector Machine (SVM):

A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In regression, SVM aims to find the hyperplane that best fits the data by maximizing the margin between data points and the hyperplane while penalizing points that fall within the margin or on the wrong side of it.
